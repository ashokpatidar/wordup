*Up your vocabulary*

Looking to improve your everyday vocabulary? Look no further. Whether you are in school, in the workplace, or merely want to add some eloquence to your dialogue, this tool will analyze your speech and then provide you with quizzes and interactive games to boost your vocabulary level.

## Motivation

While there are many indicators of a broad education, a strong command of language is certainly a major component. There are some existing tools today which can look at your spelling or your grammar, but not too many which can truly improve multiple aspects of your vocabulary. This tool aims to utilize diagnostics to analyze your current level, and then provide both fun and effective exercises to broaden the expanse of your vocabulary. The vocal diagnostic prompts also ensure that improvements are seen not only in your passive vocabulary (comprised of words you understand), but in your active vocabulary as well (words you not only understand, but actively use in your speech).
